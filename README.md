# Doggie Daycare & Boarding Reservations
Project 2 Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to the Muttel 6! This interactive web application allows users to create and update their profile information and create reservations for boarding, daycare, and grooming services. 

This was a collaborative project, creating a full-stack application to showcase our skills thus far. We have utilized the following to create this project:
* Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
* Handlebars.js as the template engine
* MySql and the Sequelize ORM for the database
* GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
* Folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
* Authentication using express-session and cookies
